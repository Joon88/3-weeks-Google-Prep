* There is only a single BST possible for a given preorder or postorder traversal

* Anything done in preorder can be done with postorder, just the other way around
e.g. preorder - 1st elt of the arr is root, postorder - last elt of the arr is root

* when the graph in question is also a tree, and the initial vertex for DFS is the
tree's root then DFS and a pre-order traversal are equivalent.

* Narrowing bound algorithm
