Important Problems :

1. Unique Paths from one grid position to another | LC-62 (https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)
Soln - Here's the recursive equation :

(considering indices to start from 1)
uniquePaths(m, n) = 1                                         ; m == n == 1 (same start and end position)
                  = uniquePaths(m-1, n)                       ; n == 1
                  = uniquePaths(m, n-1)                       ; m == 1
                  = uniquePaths(m-1, n) + uniquePaths(m, n-1) ; m > 1 && n > 1

nomral recursion - O(2^(m+n)) time and O(m+n) recursion stack space

2. Unique Paths with obstacles | LC-63 (https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/)
Soln - same as above with slight changes for the obstacles

Recursive equations :
(considering indices to start from 1)
uniquePaths(m, n) = 0                                         ; obstacleGrid[m][n] == 1
                  = 1                                         ; m == n == 1 (same start and end position)
                  = uniquePaths(m-1, n)                       ; n == 1
                  = uniquePaths(m, n-1)                       ; m == 1
                  = uniquePaths(m-1, n) + uniquePaths(m, n-1) ; m > 1 && n > 1

3. Minimum Path Sum | LC-64 (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/)
Soln - Similar concept as above.
Recursive equations :

minPathSum(m, n) = grid[m][n]                                ; m == n == 1
                 = grid[m][n] + minPathSum(m-1, n)           ; n == 1
                 = grid[m][n] + minPathSum(m, n-1)           ; m == 1
                 = grid[m][n] + Math.min(minPathSum(m-1, n),
                                         minPathSum(m, n-1)) ; m > 1 && n > 1

4. Maximal Square | LC-221 (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/)
Soln - Struggled a bit while solving, pls retry

5. Largest rectangle in histogram | LC-84 (https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-rectangle-in-histogram/)
Soln - Important to solve other rectangle/histogram problems, also uses stack.

6. Maximal rectangle | LC-85 (https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-rectangle)
Soln - My recursive solution works too. But there's a better approach that uses the largest rectangle in
histogram problem (LC-84) to solve this problem. I have also done it using another approach to find the
left and right bound alongwith the height of all possible contiguous 1s scenario, as per the YT channel
knapsack recommendation.
