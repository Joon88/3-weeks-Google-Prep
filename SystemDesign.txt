DB Sharding :
- A shard is just a horizontal partition of the database.
- In MongoDB, a replica set correspond to a shard.
- Normalization and Denormalization of data or tables :
    - Normalization : less storage space, more lookups (involving joins), updates in one place
    - Denormalization : more space, single lookup to get all reqd fields, updates may span over multiple rows, leading
    to inconsistency of data sometimes.
    - the choice depends on the user requirements.
