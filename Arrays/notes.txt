Following are some question worth revisiting :
1. https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/non-constructible-change

2. https://leetcode.com/problems/gas-station/

3. LC-387 (https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/description/)
Soln - Maintaining a linked list for remembering the order of inputs. This is nothing but an
implementation of LinkedHashMap.

4. LC-239 (https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/description/)
Soln - Utility of deque in sliding window questions. Initially I thought of max heap as a soln to this
problem, but deque is a far better approach.

5. LC-155 (https://leetcode.com/problems/min-stack/description/)
Soln - Great implementation of dynamic array.

6. LC-901 (https://leetcode.com/problems/online-stock-span/description/)
Soln - Easy, just need to figure out how to use previously calculated values to derive the new value.

7. https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/min-number-of-jumps
Soln - Look at the 2nd solution for this. Very good trick, I used BFS and given solution uses normal array tricks.

8. https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/longest-peak
Soln - Look at the 3rd approach for the optimal and easy solution
